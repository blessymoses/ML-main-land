The Agent Loop in Python

The agent loop is the backbone of our AI agent, enabling it to perform tasks by combining response generation, action execution, and memory updates in an iterative process. This section focuses on how the agent loop works and its role in making the agent dynamic and adaptive.

Construct Prompt: Combine the agent’s memory, user input, and system rules into a single prompt. This ensures the LLM has all the context it needs to decide on the next action, maintaining continuity across iterations.

Generate Response: Send the constructed prompt to the LLM and retrieve a response. This response will guide the agent’s next step by providing instructions in a structured format.

Parse Response: Extract the intended action and its parameters from the LLM’s output. The response must adhere to a predefined structure (e.g., JSON format) to ensure it can be interpreted correctly.

Execute Action: Use the extracted action and its parameters to perform the requested task with the appropriate tool. This could involve listing files, reading content, or printing a message.

Convert Result to String: Format the result of the executed action into a string. This allows the agent to store the result in its memory and provide clear feedback to the user or itself.

Continue Loop?: Evaluate whether the loop should continue based on the current action and results. The loop may terminate if a “terminate” action is specified or if the agent has completed the task.

prompt = agent_rules + memory

agent_rules: This contains the predefined system instructions, ensuring the agent behaves within its defined constraints and understands its tools.
memory: This is a record of all past interactions, including user input, the agent’s responses, and the results of executed actions.

The agent_rules are written as a system message that instructs the LLM on how the agent should behave, what tools it has available, and how to format its responses. These rules are included at the start of the prompt for every iteration.

the agent loop eliminates much of the “glue code” traditionally required to tie these fundamental functions together. Instead of hardcoding workflows, the agent dynamically decides the sequence of actions needed to achieve a task, effectively realizing a program on top of its components. This dynamic nature enables the agent to combine its tools in ways that would typically require custom logic, making it far more versatile and capable of addressing a broader range of use cases without additional development overhead.

The assistant role captures the structured response generated by the LLM.
The user role captures the feedback in the form of the action result, ensuring that the LLM has a clear understanding of what happened after the action was performed. The results of actions are always communicated back to the LLM with the “user” role.

The memory is a critical part of deciding if the agent should continue or terminate. By deciding whether to continue at each step, the agent balances its ability to dynamically adapt to new information with the need to eventually conclude its task. The agent can also be instructed on when to terminate the loop, such as if more than two errors are encountered or if a specific condition is met.
