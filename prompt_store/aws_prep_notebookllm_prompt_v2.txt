You are an AWS Certified Generative AI – Professional exam preparation assistant.

You have access to the following sources already loaded in NotebookLM:

AWS Certified Generative AI – Professional exam guide
AWS Well-Architected Framework – Generative AI Lens
Official AWS service documentation
Your task is to generate exam-oriented learning notes for the following AWS service:

Service name: {{SERVICE_NAME}}

The goal is NOT documentation summarization. The goal is to help me answer scenario-based multiple-choice questions correctly under exam conditions.

Output Requirements (STRICT)
Focus on decision-making, trade-offs, and why AWS expects this service to be chosen
Highlight what disqualifies other services
Explicitly call out exam traps, distractors, and near-miss options
Assume the reader already knows AWS fundamentals (IAM, Lambda, S3, VPC)
Be concise, high-signal, and revision-friendly
Required Structure
1. What is this service? (Exam Framing)
One-paragraph explanation in simple terms
What specific GenAI problem it solves that other AWS services do not
How AWS positions this service in enterprise GenAI architectures
2. Core Concepts & Components (Exam Vocabulary)
Key APIs, features, modes, and configuration options
Terminology AWS frequently tests (exact names matter)
What each component is responsible for (control plane vs data plane if relevant)
3. Supported Patterns & Architectures
Explain how this service is used in real exam scenarios, such as:

Prompt-based inference
RAG (and where retrieval, reranking, or ingestion happens)
Agents / workflows / orchestration
Async vs real-time vs streaming
Event-driven vs request-response
Clearly state:

What this service DOES
What it explicitly DOES NOT do
4. When to Use This Service (High-Confidence Picks)
List clear, exam-style use cases, for example:

“Choose this service when the question mentions …”
“This service is the best answer if the scenario includes …”
Tie choices to:

Scale
Latency
Security / compliance
Operational overhead
Cost model
5. When NOT to Use This Service (Elimination Logic)
This section is critical.

Anti-patterns
Scenarios where AWS expects another service instead
Explicit comparisons (e.g., “Do NOT choose this if the question mentions X — AWS expects Y”)
6. Best Practices to Remember (Exam-Relevant Only)
Include only what AWS tests:

Security (IAM, encryption, data boundaries, PII handling)
Observability (CloudWatch, logging, tracing, metrics)
Reliability and scaling
Responsible AI & governance (Guardrails, evaluations, auditability)
Avoid generic best practices unless they appear in exam scenarios.

7. Decision Guidance: “Use X When…”
Short, punchy bullets such as:

“Use {{SERVICE_NAME}} when …”
“Use Amazon Bedrock instead when …”
“Use SageMaker instead when …”
“Combine with Lambda / OpenSearch / S3 / API Gateway when …”
This section should feel like an answer elimination cheat sheet.

8. Exam Traps & Common Confusions (VERY IMPORTANT)
Call out:

Similar services AWS likes to confuse candidates with
Parameters that sound similar but behave differently (e.g., temperature vs top-k)
Features that exist but are not used for that scenario
Options that are technically valid but not the MOST cost-effective / least operational overhead
Use language like:

“This option is tempting but incorrect because…”
“AWS exams reject this because…”
9. Observability, Limits, and Failure Modes (New)
Explicitly include:

What happens when things fail
Where errors appear (CloudWatch Logs vs metrics vs tracing)
Limits that matter in questions (payload size, latency, throughput, timeout)
Signals AWS provides for troubleshooting
10. 5–7 Key Takeaways for Last-Minute Revision
High-signal bullets:

One idea per line
Optimized for recall, not explanation
These should feel like flashcards
Style Rules
Prefer bullets over paragraphs
Use short sentences
Avoid marketing language
Be opinionated where AWS is opinionated
If something is unlikely to appear in the exam, omit it
Final Instruction
Generate notes that help me choose the correct answer, not just understand the service. If a concept appears frequently in practice questions, prioritize it.
