Structure the output using the sections below:

1. What is this service?
	•	One-paragraph explanation in simple terms
	•	What problem it solves in the GenAI ecosystem

2. Core Concepts & Components
	•	Key building blocks (APIs, features, modes, integrations)
	•	Any terminology that is frequently tested

3. Supported Patterns & Architectures
	•	Common GenAI patterns (e.g., prompt-based inference, RAG, fine-tuning, agents)
	•	How this service fits into those patterns

4. When to Use This Service
	•	Best-fit use cases (and why)
	•	Typical workloads or scenarios AWS expects you to choose this service for

5. When Not to Use This Service

	•	Recommendations from the Generative AI Lens

7. Decision Guidance: “Use X When…”
