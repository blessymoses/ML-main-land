A riskprofiling agent could build a comprehensive risk profile for each case, using existing underwriting guidelines. 
A pricing and product agent could automatically price the case and suggest policy structures to meet customer needs, for instance, by adding critical illness or disability riders to a life insurance policy. 
A compliance and fairness agent could review the entire process to ensure regulatory compliance and high ethical standards. 
A decision orchestrator agent could aggregate input from various other agents to determine if the policy can be automatically approved or if it needs to be escalated to a human senior underwriter for review given the size of the policy or other factors. 
A learning and feedback agent could continuously refine models, use human feedback to improve, and track drift, or degradation of a machine learning model’s performance over time.
