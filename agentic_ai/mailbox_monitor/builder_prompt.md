Here is a single, clean paragraph-style builder prompt you can paste directly into Microsoft Copilot Agent Studio to generate the agentic workflow:

Create an agentic workflow for an insurance contact center shared email inbox. The workflow should continuously monitor incoming emails, classify the content, validate the customer, determine the query type, respond automatically where possible, and escalate when needed. The first step is the Inbox Classification Agent, which reads every new email, analyzes the subject, body, and sender, and classifies the email as one of the following: irrelevant/spam/phishing, general information, policy enquiry, premium enquiry, claims enquiry, beneficiary addition, new claim, or unknown. If the email is irrelevant, spam, or suspected phishing, the agent must automatically reply with a polite rejection message and immediately escalate the case by sending an escalation email to Blessy and cc Shobhit, including the original email context. For all legitimate queries, pass the extracted fields (customer name, policy number, contact details, etc.) to the Customer Validation Agent. This agent must match the sender against the internal Entity Info Excel Sheet stored in SharePoint/OneDrive. If information is insufficient, the agent must email the sender requesting missing details such as full name, policy number, or ID, and pause the workflow. If the customer cannot be found or validated, reply that identification is not possible and escalate to Blessy (cc Shobhit). If the customer is valid, route the email and validated customer data to the Query Routing Agent. This agent determines the response source based on classification: for policy enquiries, retrieve data from the Policy Excel Sheet; for premium enquiries, use the Premium Excel Sheet; for claims enquiries or new claims, use the Claims Details Excel Sheet; for beneficiary addition, reply with correct steps based on available internal guidelines. The agent must generate a clear, personalized response to the customer using only safe, customer-appropriate data from the Excel sheets. For general information queries, respond if knowledge exists; if not, escalate. For any case that cannot be resolved automatically (unknown type, missing knowledge, ambiguous intent), trigger the Escalation Handler to email Blessy (cc Shobhit) with a summary and the original email. Every escalated email must contain: reason for escalation, customer details (if available), classification, and full email content. The workflow must ensure safe handling of phishing/spam, strict customer verification before answering, accurate use of internal Excel knowledge bases, and clean routing to appropriate automated or human paths.
