Prompt engineering is both an art and science - it's the iterative process of crafting effective inputs for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate desired outputs. Like writing code, it requires experimentation and refinement to achieve optimal results.

Components of an effective prompt
Task description: clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
Context information: relevant background or data
Model instructions: specific guidance and constraints
Style/Format requirements: output structure and tone preferences

iterative approach for effective prompts:
Start with a basic prompt.
Add structure and context.
Refine instructions.
Specify format requirements.
Test and adjust based on results.

Remember: The goal is to experiment with different versions until you get the desired output quality and consistency.

In addition to building structured prompts, several widely used techniques can improve accuracy, reasoning, or creativity in model responses. These include one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-based prompting.

One-Shot Prompting
Provide one example to guide the model.
Few-Shot Prompting
Provide multiple examples to help the model generalize a pattern.
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Encourages the model to show intermediate reasoning steps before delivering an answer. Useful for math, logic, or decision-making tasks.
Role-Based or Persona Prompting
Helps steer tone and domain-specific language.
